The mods in this pack are chosen for maximum compatibility to minimize desyncs.

## Host Installation
*NOTE*: Only the person hosting the server needs to install config, as clients can sync when connecting.

1. Click `Subscribe to all` on the ![Steam](https://i.imgur.com/XEAiSka.png) [Mod Collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2257918295) (like and favorite if you choose)
2. Download the [latest config files here](https://github.com/ubergarm/rimworld-mp-qol-mp/archive/master.zip)
3. Copy/paste the `Config` and `HugsLib` folders from the zip replacing yours e.g. `C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Config`

*NOTE*: You might want to backup your existing `Config` and `HugsLib` folders first!

## Quick Start
1. the host must finish installation above
2. the host starts a single playergame, configures the map and loadout, then save game immedeately
3. the host presses `Escape` to open the game menu and clicks `Host a server`
4. clients connect via the allowed method and download/sync mods and config from host
5. the host must open the chat tab in top right and accept clients attempting to join

Have fun!

## Tips
1. the host might want to change their username in the multiplayer configs
2. disable arbiter to prevent host "desyncing from itsef"
3. if clients desyncs and cannot resync, the host can `save replay` `full save` and then client can rejoin
4. the host can type `/autosave` in chat to force a save to speed up resync as it simulates from last save

## Mod Compatibility
There are many other great mods that don't seem quite stable enough
on the version available at this time. Here is a list of a few that
I would like to include, but didn't because the given features cause
desync consistently despite being listed as compatible level 3 or 4.

* [Allow Tool](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761421485)
  - Strip Mining, Drafted Hunt, and Allow Entire Map hotkey
* [Smart Medicine](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1309994319)
  - Stock Up inventory
* [Follow Me](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=715759739)
  - Cinematic Camera modes

Also I restricted this pack to only mods hosted on Steam workshop, and
of course there are many other possible mods that I just don't know about.

## Issues
If you find something that consistently causes desync issues, please
report it here in the Issue Tracker, or in the collection comments if
you don't have github access.
